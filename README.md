# About 

This is a frontend part for **interview-project**. Made on IV/V 2018.
(More info about project, which I dont want to put in Readme file, will be send via mail/message directly to Recruiter)


The backend part is available at:
https://github.com/Sazar24/backEnd-ts


#
## *The task original content goes as follow:*

Please create a simple app that stores data submitted by a form (in short: react.js + node.js).

The form should contain fields listed below:
- First name (required)
- Last name (required)
- Email (required, valid email address)
- Event date (required, simple date picker)

Our requirements:
- Frontend should be written using React (Redux will be very appreciated),
- Backend should be written in Node,
- Data from form should be saved in DB (we suggest MongoDB)
- Data from form should be validated before saving
- Errors should be handled and displayed for the user
- App should be tested (It's your decision what kind of tests are necessary)
- UI is not important for us. You can use your favorite framework (for example Bootstrap) or write everything on your own.
- If you have any questions, don't be afraid and ask
